# Red Wine Quality Dataset Analysis

Project by Emilija B. originally created in **November 2022**. The project was uploaded later because it was previously stored in a different repository.
 
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file named "235.ipynb" which analyzes the quality of red wine using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this analysis is the "Wine Quality" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Requirements

* Python 3.6 or above
* Jupyter Notebook
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## Installation

* Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/baranema/Red_Wine_Quality_Analysis.git.
 
## Usage

* Open the Jupyter Notebook file 235.ipynb.
* Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and analyze the quality of the red wine using various machine learning algorithms.

## Contents

The notebook contains the following sections:

* Introduction: Provides an overview of the dataset and the analysis goals.
* Data Loading: Loads the dataset into a Pandas dataframe.
* Data Exploration: Explores the dataset by analyzing the data distribution and correlations.
* Data Preprocessing: Cleans the data by removing missing values and outliers, and scales the data using StandardScaler.
* Model Training: Trains several machine learning models on the preprocessed data, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of the trained models using various metrics, including mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared score.
* Conclusion: Summarizes the analysis results and suggests future directions.
